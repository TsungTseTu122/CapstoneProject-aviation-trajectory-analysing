# aviation-trajectory-prediction
This research extends a pre-trained trajectory prediction model to enhance its ability to handle Out-of-Distribution (OOD) and Non-IID data in General Aviation (GA) flight trajectories. Key improvements include synthetic data augmentation, uncertainty estimation using Mahalanobis Distance, and model fine-tuning.
